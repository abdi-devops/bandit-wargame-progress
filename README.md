# OverTheWire Bandit Progress

This repo tracks my progress through the [OverTheWire Bandit wargame](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/).
Iâ€™m documenting each level with the goal, commands used, and what I learned.

NB: No passwords will be included.

## Why?
- Build Linux confidence
- Practice problem-solving
- Create a personal reference for myself and my future DevOps work
